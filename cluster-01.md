The command `sudo sysctl --system` serves to:
1. Purpose:
   - Reload all system configurations
   - Apply the network settings immediately without requiring a reboot

2. What it does:
   - Reads and loads all system configuration files
   - Applies the new network parameters we just set:
     - Enables IPv4 packet forwarding
     - Configures bridge networking to work with iptables
     - Allows container networking to function properly

3. Why it's important:
   - Essential for Kubernetes networking to work correctly
   - Ensures all network configurations are active immediately
   - Validates that the settings were applied successfully
